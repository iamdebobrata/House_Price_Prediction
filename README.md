House Price Prediction

Overview::

This repository contains a Python script for predicting house prices in Bengaluru based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bathrooms, and bedrooms.

Getting Started::

Prerequisites::

Make sure you have the following installed:

Python (3.x)

Jupyter Notebook (optional)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/bengaluru-house-prices.git

Install the required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:

jupyter notebook Bengaluru_House_Prices.ipynb

or

python Bengaluru_House_Prices.py

Project Structure::

Bengaluru_House_Prices.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire code.

Bengaluru_House_Prices.py: Python script equivalent to the Jupyter Notebook.

bengaluru_house_prices.csv: Dataset used for analysis and prediction.


Data Preprocessing::

Loading the dataset using pandas.

Handling missing values and irrelevant columns.

Converting square footage values to a consistent format.

Exploratory Data Analysis::

Visualizing and analyzing the distribution of house prices.

Handling outliers in the dataset.

Exploring the relationship between the number of bathrooms and bedrooms.

Model Training::

Feature engineering and one-hot encoding of categorical variables.

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Training a Linear Regression model for price prediction.

Model Evaluation::

Evaluating the model's performance using R-squared score.

Performing cross-validation to assess generalization performance.

Future Improvements::


Implementing a more sophisticated model (e.g., Lasso regression, decision tree) and tuning hyperparameters.

Improving feature engineering and handling categorical variables more effectively.
